# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome and help refine and improve any package.
I only ask that you think through and put effort into any suggestions.

## How
- Create an issue with possible features
- Create an issue with bugs. Please include some sample data or code to help resolve the bug quickly.
- Add new tests and examples
- Your own code improvement. See the section below about pull requests.

## Pull Requests
1. Confirm that the code you add doesn't break anything. Run `npm run prep` to confirm `lint`, `flow` and tests still run.
1. Add tests for any new code behavior to confirm what you expect works.
